## About The Project

1) Logistic regression was implemented on PyTorch;
2) Was trained on the KMNIST dataset using:

- PyTorch,
- Catalyst,
- Ignite,
- Lightning,
- fastai.


## Getting Started

Files to run:

    1) PyTorch implementation: main.py
    2) Other implementations: <Catalyst/Ignite/Lightning/Fastai>Code/main.py
